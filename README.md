# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
**Project Overview**

Customer Segmentation Analysis is a project aimed at understanding customer behavior and trends using SQL and Power BI. The analysis includes insights into gender- and age-wise shopping distributions, revenue generation, and purchase patterns across different categories and payment methods. The results were visualized using Power BI to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

1. **Dataset Description**

About Dataset:
This dataset contains shopping information from 10 different shopping malls between 2021 and 2023. We have gathered data from various age groups and genders to provide a comprehensive view of shopping habits in Istanbul. The dataset includes essential information such as invoice numbers, customer IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations.

3. **Attribute Information**
   
- invoice_no: A combination of the letter 'I'; and a 6-digit integer uniquely assigned to each operation,
- customer_id: A combination of the letter 'C' and a 6-digit integer uniquely assigned to each operation,
- gender: String variable of the customer's gender,
- age: Positive Integer variable of the customers age,
- category: String variable of the category of the purchased product,
- quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction,
- price: Product price per unit in Turkish Liras (TL),
- payment_method: String variable of the payment method (cash, credit card or debit card) used for the transaction,
- invoice_date: The day when a transaction was generated,
- shopping_mall: String variable of the name of the shopping mall where the transaction was made.

5. **Objective/Task**

- How is the shopping distribution according to gender?
- Which gender did we sell more products to?
- Which gender generated more revenue?
- Distribution of purchase categories relative to other columns?
- How is the shopping distribution according to age?
- Which age cat did we sell more products to?
- Which age cat generated more revenue?
- Does the payment method have a relation with other columns?
- How is the distribution of the payment method?
- Visualize the data using Tableau /PowerBI and derive insights and give your inputs/suggestions to the company.

7. **Process**

 Data Exploration:
 - Used power bi to clean the dataset.
 - Checked for missing or inconsistent data.

 Data Analysis in SQL:
 - Performed queries to calculate total purchases, revenue, and distributions by gender and age.
 - Grouped data by category, payment_method, and other columns to identify patterns.

 Visualization in Power BI:
 - Created visuals such as bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent gender-wise, age-wise, and payment method distributions.
 - Designed dashboards with KPIs and slicers for interactive exploration.

5. **Insights and Recommendations**
   
 Insights:
 - Female customers purchased more products and generated higher revenue compared to males.
 - Customers in the age group 25–34 were the most active shoppers and the largest contributors to revenue.
 - Cash was the most preferred payment method, especially for lower-value purchases.

 Recommendations:
 - Introduce targeted marketing campaigns for the 25–34 age group and female customers.
 - Offer discounts or incentives on non-cash payment methods to diversify payment preferences.

6. **Tools Used**

- SQL for querying and data manipulation.
- Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation.
